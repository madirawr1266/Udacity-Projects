                    <h2>Healer's Log: April 15th, 2024</h2>
                    <p>Today I started a new character.  A warrior of the light, known as a Holy Paladin.  I've donned my armor and joined my friends.  We are going to try to clear a dungeon called <strong>The Nokhud Offensive</strong>.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>So far the dungeon is going well.  We were a little confused in the beginning.  Who would have thought that this dungeon requires us to fly to the boss.  I love to dragonride. So seeing this in the dungeon was a pleasant surprise.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="/Udacity Blog Project/assets/images/DRAGON MOUNT 2.png" alt="Holy Paladin sitting on a Dragonriding Mount">
                        <figcaption>My favorite dragonriding mount.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>There he was . . . Granyth, the fearsome dragon that has been terrorizing the natives.<p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="/Udacity Blog Project/assets/images/gRANYTH.png" alt="Granyth the dragon">
                        <figcaption>The fearsome dragon, Granyth.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    </p>The dragon was no easy foe.  He gave us a quite a bit of trouble.  The damage from this dragon was insanse!  Whenever he casted <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388283/eruption?dd=205">Eruption</a> we would struggle to survive. I wasn't able to heal through the damage the boss was putting out.  Self doubt set in. I was really feeling like a failure. But then, one of my team members clicked on a nearby catapult and launched a lance in the boss's direction. <strong>STUNNING THE BOSS!</strong> Needless to say, Granyth won't be giving us any more trouble.</p>

                      </figure>
                    <p>Overall, this encounter was a struggle. 
                     But I did learn something new.  Sometimes it's not my fault when my teammates die.  It may be just a click of a button that saves the day.  <em>Note to self: study the mechanics of each fight before engaging in battle.</em></p>
